# Movie-Genre-Classification

In this project, we predict all the genres (up to 27 genres) that a movie can be classified into based on the plot. The data set is obtained from IMDB and contains plot and the genre information of 117194 movies. This is a multi-label classification problem. The below figure plots the number of genres each movie is classified into in the data set. There are movies which fall under 12 genres!
