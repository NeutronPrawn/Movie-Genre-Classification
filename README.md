# Movie-Genre-Classification

In this particular endeavor, our objective revolves around predicting the comprehensive range of genres, up to 27 in total, to which a movie can be attributed based on its plot. The dataset utilized in this project has been meticulously collected from IMDB, encompassing the plot summaries and corresponding genre information for an extensive pool of 117,194 movies. Our task at hand, therefore, entails tackling a challenging multi-label classification problem.

Notably, upon scrutinizing the provided dataset, it is evident that certain movies are remarkably diverse in nature, warranting classification across a remarkable spectrum of 12 distinct genres. This intriguing observation accentuates the complexity and intricacy of our classification task, necessitating a robust and adaptable approach to accurately predict multiple genres for each movie based on its plot.
